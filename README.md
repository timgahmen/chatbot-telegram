> Yet another telegram ChatGPT bot which allows you to setup and run your bot with one simple command. PRs and suggestions are welcome. Leave a üåü if you find this project helpful.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: The underlying model is currently `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which is already fine-tuned for conversation **but costs money**. *A new OpenAI account comes with $18 free credit though, which is enough to run this bot for some time.*

> Support for using a reverse proxy to access the origin ChatGPT will be added soon.
